# cr_program_settings
A library that simplifies the process of saving a struct containing the program settings to a file somewhere safe.
At the moment, the program allows you to give it a struct, and it will save it in the users home directory with the name of the program using the library.
Pretty minimal library that I plan on using for my other projects going forward.
